"""
scheduler/ — Task Scheduler (stub)

Reserved for future autonomous task scheduling (cron-style triggers,
deferred goals, periodic memory maintenance).

Not active during the kernel hardening phase. Added to the folder
structure as a placeholder per the recommended layout in the Core
Hardening Plan.

When the scheduler is implemented it will export:
    from neuralclaw.scheduler.scheduler import TaskScheduler
